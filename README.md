Introduction
For this semester, I want to do something that combines all three profile subjects in the entrepreneurship profile. I wish to make a tool that takes financial data and stock prices for a specific company for a specific period, drafts an analysis of that particular stock, and possibly makes a prediction on where that stock will go.
Design
The bulk of the project will be programmed in Python. The script will be the backbone of the project with the rest branching off. It will simply provide data. Data is read from the YahooFinance API and then formatted to show stock prices for the specified company. The idea is that after the script runs data is put into an Excel spreadsheet, which already has charts, formulas, etc. so that it can be viewed with ease. After the core functionalities are implemented, I can start thinking about whether to add other features to expand the program, such as a GUI, AI-powered predictions, etc.
Final product
In the end, I expect to have a fully functional, albeit simple, stock analysis software, utilising Excel, Python and other topics discussed in class.
